grub2-bootable-usb
==================

My personal grub.cfg backup, and public reference for anyone who wants it.

All options thus far built by myself using various forums scattered across the internet.

If you have anything to contribute, or if you know of a way of doing things better than what I've done, please let me know. I'd love for this to become a decent public reference point for creating a bootable USB.
